# ![e18e & friends](/og/community-showcase-25-q3.png)

We're starting a new community show: _e18e & Friends_!

## What is e18e & Friends?

**e18e & Friends** is a new live streamed show where we catch up with friends from around the JavaScript ecosystem. Often people working on performance and modernization projects, but really anyone who has something interesting to share!

The e18e community has so many amazing people from all corners of the JavaScript ecosystem. Library authors, contributors, engine implementors, framework maintainers, and many more. We'd love to bring some of these folks together and provide a platform to share their work more widely.

## Introducing the host...

As the host, we're super excited to have [@TheAlexLichter](https://bsky.app/profile/thealexlichter.com) on board!

Alex has been a long time advocate for performance in the JavaScript ecosystem. As part of the [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/) team, he's also been hard at work pushing web tooling forward with projects like [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/).

He's also done some great talks and has hosted the [DejaVue](https://dejavue.fm/) podcast for some time now, so we're really excited to have him leading the show.

## The format

Each episode will focus around a guest from the community who will share some of the exciting work they're doing, or just have a chat about performance with us in general.

There will be a small segment where we catch up on what's new in the ecosystem, and what the e18e community has been up to this month.

We'll also spend some time answering questions from the audience, so make sure to tune in live if you can!

## Join us live!

If you'd like to join us live for the first episode of _e18e & Friends_, you can find the event on [Discord](https://chat.e18e.dev). We will be streaming on **February 10th, 2026 at ?? GMT**.
