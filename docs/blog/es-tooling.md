# ES Tooling

_July 22, 2024_

The e18e initiative has seen huge growth since launch. We've seen hundreds of performance contributions upstream to popular projects, and the creation of many community lead tools.

A notable example of this is the [ES Tooling](https://github.com/orgs/es-tooling/repositories) community GitHub organisation.

The ES Tooling organisation has been created to hold various e18e-focused tools and forks maintained by the community.

## A home for e18e-focused tools

Over the last few months, many of us have collaborated and connected through the e18e community. The ES tooling organisation is a result of that - a place for us to store and own forks, tools, and other code bases we're working on together.

A few popular projects that were running solo until now, have come together to create this:

- [ecosystem cleanup](https://github.com/43081j/ecosystem-cleanup).
- [module replacements](https://github.com/es-tooling/module-replacements).
- [module replacements code mods](https://github.com/thepassle/module-replacements-codemods)
- [fd-package-json](https://github.com/es-tooling/fd-package-json)

The ES Tooling org predates the creation of the e18e initiative. In case you're wondering about why these efforts won't live under the e18e org, we think that it is better to keep this organization focused on [fostering the space to connect us](https://chat.e18e.dev/), and maintaining a curation of ecosystem performance projects.

## Ecosystem cleanup

One of the projects which kicked much of this initiative off - the ecosystem cleanup project has now moved into the ES Tooling organisation to allow better visibility and maintenance.

The cleanup project exists primarily as an issue tracker, tracking:

- Footprint reduction in popular packages
- Missing forks or alternatives that could be worked on
- Performance improvements in popular packages

If you want to help out, this project is a good starting point to find some open issues.

Read more at the [ecosystem cleanup project](https://github.com/es-tooling/ecosystem-cleanup).

## Module replacements

The module replacements project is a community lead list of popular npm packages and their possible replacements.

Often, these replacements are native, or much faster and more modern packages. If you know of a good alternative to something, get involved and add to the list!
