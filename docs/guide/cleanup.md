# Cleanup

The JavaScript ecosystem has grown massively over the years, in good and bad ways. We have all the packages and choice we want, but have built up a vast amount of technical debt along the way.

Much of this is in the form of packages which are redundant, bloated or have since fallen out of active maintenance.

In an attempt to clean this up, the [ecosystem-cleanup effort](https://github.com/43081j/ecosystem-cleanup) has been started.

This project aims to drive contributions upstream to many different open-source projects. A few of the things we will do:

- Modernize existing packages
- Migrate from redundant packages
- Migrate from inactive packages
- Migrate to lighter and/or faster alternatives

If you'd like to get involved, we suggest reading the [Ecosystem Cleanup Guide](https://github.com/43081j/ecosystem-cleanup/blob/main/docs/guide.md), which explains how to discover common problems to resolve in upstream packages.

And make sure to checkout the [Module Replacements](https://github.com/es-tooling/module-replacements/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#module-replacements) project. It provides a collection of module replacements (i.e. possible alternative packages) and tools to automatically detect possible improvements.
