# Replacements for `traverse`

## `neotraverse`

[`neotraverse`](https://github.com/puruvj/neotraverse) is a TypeScript rewrite of [`traverse`](https://github.com/ljharb/js-traverse) with no dependencies. It offers a dropâ€‘in compatible build as well as a modern API.

```ts
import traverse from 'traverse' // [!code --]
import traverse from 'neotraverse' // [!code ++]

const obj = [5, 6, -3, [7, 8, -2, 1], { f: 10, g: -13 }]

traverse(obj).forEach(function (x) {
  if (x < 0) this.update(x + 128)
})

console.log(obj)
```
