# Levelup

Especially with the features modern runtimes bring today, many packages can now
be leaner, faster and more focused.

Just like the introduction of esbuild as a lean alternative when you don't
need the full customisability of webpack, these packages are here to be
**fast and small**.

Some projects contributing heavily to this effort:

- [Tinylibs](https://github.com/tinylibs)
- [unjs](https://github.com/unjs/)
- [es-tooling](https://github.com/es-tooling/)

The levelup and cleanup efforts cross paths often, as these focused packages
greatly reduce your install size while giving you great perf boosts.
