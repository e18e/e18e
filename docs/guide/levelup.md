# Levelup

With the features available today in modern JavaScript runtimes, many packages can now be leaner, faster, and more focused.

Just like the introduction of esbuild as a lean alternative when you don't need the full customizability of webpack, these packages are here to be **fast and small**.

Some projects contributing heavily to this effort:

- [Tinylibs](https://github.com/tinylibs)
- [unjs](https://github.com/unjs/)
- [es-tooling](https://github.com/es-tooling/)

The levelup and cleanup efforts cross paths often, as these focused packages greatly reduce install size while giving great performance boosts.
