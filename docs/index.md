## Welcome to e18e!

e18e (Ecosystem Performance) is an initiative to connect the folks and projects working to improve the performance of JS packages.

We'd also like to provide visibility to the efforts of countless open source developers working to cleanup, levelup, and speedup our dependencies.

We invite you to get involved in the different projects linked from these pages, and to connect with other like-minded folks.

Join us at the [e18e Discord server](https://chat.e18e.dev) and collaborate with our community!

### Sponsor the Community

Sponsorships make a lot of our community's work possible. We primarily use them to reward members who have made great steps ahead in the ecosystem, or to fund larger projects which need more attention.

You can help out by sponsoring our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/e18e) :blue_heart:.
