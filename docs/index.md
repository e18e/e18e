## Welcome to e18e!

e18e (Ecosystem Performance) is an initiative to connect the folks and projects working to improve JS packages performance.

We'd also like to provide visibility to the efforts of countless Open Source developers working to cleanup, levelup, and speedup our dependencies.

We invite you to get involved in the different projects linked from these pages, and to connect with others like-minded folks.

Join us at the [e18e Discord server](https://chat.e18e.dev) and collaborate with us!
