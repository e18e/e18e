# Cleanup

The JavaScript ecosystem has grown massively over the years, in good and bad
ways. We have all the packages and choice we want, but have built up a vast
amount of technical debt along the way.

Much of this is in the form of packages which are redundant, bloated or have
since fallen out of active maintanence.

In an attempt to clean up this up, the
[ecosystem-cleanup effort](https://github.com/43081j/ecosystem-cleanup) has
been started.

This project aims to drive contributions upstream to many different open-source
projects. A few of the things we will do:

- Modernise existing packages
- Migrate from redundant packages
- Migrate from inactive packages
- Migrate to lighter and/or faster alternatives
