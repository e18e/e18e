# Replacements for `bluebird` / `q`

## `Promise` (native)

[`bluebird`](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8Fnote%EF%B8%8F) and [`q`](https://github.com/kriskowal/q#note) recommend switching away from them to native promises.

## NativeBird

[`NativeBird`](https://github.com/doodlewind/nativebird) is an ultralight native `Promise` extension that provides Bluebird-like helpers if you miss a few conveniences from Bluebird.
